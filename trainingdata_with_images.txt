<p><b>Humans</b> (<i><b>Homo sapiens</b></i>, meaning "thinking man") or <b>modern humans</b>  are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus <i>Homo</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence.  Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations.  Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of cooperating, distinct, or even competing social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states.  As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society.  Humans are also highly curious, with the desire to understand and influence phenomena having motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine.  There are estimated to be more than eight billion humans alive. 
</p><p>Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, in common usage it generally refers to <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the only extant member.  All other members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term "modern human" is used to distinguish <i>Homo sapiens</i> from archaic humans.  Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> or a similar species.  Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans.  Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with <i>Homo sapiens</i>, or inability to adapt to climate change.  Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago.  For most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers.  The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change.  Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle. 
</p><p>Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span.  Though humans vary in many traits, humans are among the least genetically diverse species.  Any two humans are at least 99. 5% genetically similar.  Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage.  At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics.  Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.  As omnivorous creatures, they are capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of <i>Homo erectus</i>.  Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water.  Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day.  Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death.  Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. 
</p><p>Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.  Humans are highly intelligent and capable of episodic memory; they have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind.  The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence.  This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations through language. 
</p><p>Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment.  They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.  Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.  Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space.  Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.  Humans have briefly visited the Moon and made their presence felt on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.  Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.

<p><b>Humans</b> (<i><b>Homo sapiens</b></i>, meaning "thinking man") or <b>modern humans</b>  are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus <i>Homo</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence.  Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations.  Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of cooperating, distinct, or even competing social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states.  As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society.  Humans are also highly curious, with the desire to understand and influence phenomena having motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine.  There are estimated to be more than eight billion humans alive. 
</p><p>Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, in common usage it generally refers to <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the only extant member.  All other members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term "modern human" is used to distinguish <i>Homo sapiens</i> from archaic humans.  Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> or a similar species.  Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans.  Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with <i>Homo sapiens</i>, or inability to adapt to climate change.  Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago.  For most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers.  The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change.  Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle. 
</p><p>Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span.  Though humans vary in many traits, humans are among the least genetically diverse species.  Any two humans are at least 99. 5% genetically similar.  Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage.  At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics.  Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.  As omnivorous creatures, they are capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of <i>Homo erectus</i>.  Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water.  Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day.  Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death.  Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. 
</p><p>Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.  Humans are highly intelligent and capable of episodic memory; they have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind.  The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence.  This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations through language. 
</p><p>Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment.  They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.  Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.  Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space.  Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.  Humans have briefly visited the Moon and made their presence felt on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.  Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.

<p><b>Chocolate</b> is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa beans that can be a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring in other foods</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  The cacao tree has been used as a source of food for at least 5,300 years, starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador.  Later, Mesoamerican civilizations consumed cacao beverages, of which one, chocolate, was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. 
</p><p>The seeds of the cacao tree (<i>Theobroma cacao</i>) have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted.  The shell is removed to produce nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form.  Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor.  The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.  Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar.  Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa.  Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and added vegetable oils and sugar.  Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder.  White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. 
</p><p>Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, brownies, and chocolate chip cookies.  Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate.  Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks.  Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah.  Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as crème de cacao. 
</p><p>Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Ivory Coast and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.  A 2020 report estimated that more than 1. 5 million children are involved in the farming of cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.  Child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns.  A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, the absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.

<p>A <b>home</b>, or <b>domicile</b>, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or more human occupants, and sometimes various companion animals</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  It is a fully- or semi-sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.  Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. 
</p><p>Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.  The aspect of 'home' can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet. 
</p><p>The concept of 'home' has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics.  The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.  The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.

The entity identified by a name is called its referent.  A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a <i>specific</i> individual human.  The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun.  Other nouns are sometimes called "<b>common names</b>" or (obsolete) "<b>general names</b>".  A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.

According to the Bible, he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus. 
</p><p>The Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan.  In Numbers 13:1 and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes.  According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age.  According to Joshua 24:29 Joshua died at the age of 110. 
</p><p>Joshua holds a position of respect among Muslims, who also see him as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses.  In Islam, it is also believed that Yusha bin Nun (Joshua) was the "attendant" of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr.  Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.

<p>A <b>banana</b> is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <i>Musa</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing them from <b>dessert bananas</b>.  The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors when ripe.  It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant.  Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) cultivated bananas come from two wild species – <i>Musa acuminata</i> and <i>Musa balbisiana</i>, or hybrids of them.  
</p><p><i>Musa</i> species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia; they were probably domesticated in New Guinea.  They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make banana paper and textiles, while some are grown as ornamental plants.  The world's largest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production.  Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in recipes varying from curries to banana chips, fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed. 
</p><p>Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between dessert "bananas" and cooking "plantains": this works well enough in the Americas and Europe, but it breaks down in Southeast Asia where many more kinds of bananas are grown and eaten.  The term "banana" is applied also to other members of the genus <i>Musa</i>, such as the scarlet banana (<i>Musa coccinea</i>), the pink banana (<i>Musa velutina</i>), and the Fe'i bananas.  Members of the genus <i>Ensete</i>, such as the snow banana (<i>Ensete glaucum</i>) and the economically important false banana (<i>Ensete ventricosum</i>) of Africa are sometimes included.  Both genera are in the banana family, Musaceae. 
</p><p>Banana plantations are subject to damage by parasitic nematodes and insect pests, and to fungal and bacterial diseases, one of the most serious being Panama disease which is caused by a <i>Fusarium</i> fungus.  This and black sigatoka threaten the production of Cavendish bananas, the main kind eaten in the Western world, which is a triploid <i>Musa acuminata</i>.  Plant breeders are seeking new varieties, but these are difficult to breed given that commercial varieties are seedless.  To enable future breeding, banana germplasm is conserved in multiple gene banks around the world.

<p>An <b>apple</b> is a round, edible fruit produced by an <b>apple tree</b> (<i>Malus spp</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong> </i>, among them the <b>domestic</b> or <b>orchard apple</b>; <i><b>Malus domestica</b></i>).  Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus <i>Malus</i>.  The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, <i>Malus sieversii</i>, is still found.  Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists.  Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. 
</p><p>Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics.  For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks.  Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting.  Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. 
</p><p>There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.  Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production.  Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means.  In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

<p>A <b>banana</b> is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <i>Musa</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing them from <b>dessert bananas</b>.  The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors when ripe.  It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant.  Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) cultivated bananas come from two wild species – <i>Musa acuminata</i> and <i>Musa balbisiana</i>, or hybrids of them.  
</p><p><i>Musa</i> species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia; they were probably domesticated in New Guinea.  They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make banana paper and textiles, while some are grown as ornamental plants.  The world's largest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production.  Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in recipes varying from curries to banana chips, fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed. 
</p><p>Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between dessert "bananas" and cooking "plantains": this works well enough in the Americas and Europe, but it breaks down in Southeast Asia where many more kinds of bananas are grown and eaten.  The term "banana" is applied also to other members of the genus <i>Musa</i>, such as the scarlet banana (<i>Musa coccinea</i>), the pink banana (<i>Musa velutina</i>), and the Fe'i bananas.  Members of the genus <i>Ensete</i>, such as the snow banana (<i>Ensete glaucum</i>) and the economically important false banana (<i>Ensete ventricosum</i>) of Africa are sometimes included.  Both genera are in the banana family, Musaceae. 
</p><p>Banana plantations are subject to damage by parasitic nematodes and insect pests, and to fungal and bacterial diseases, one of the most serious being Panama disease which is caused by a <i>Fusarium</i> fungus.  This and black sigatoka threaten the production of Cavendish bananas, the main kind eaten in the Western world, which is a triploid <i>Musa acuminata</i>.  Plant breeders are seeking new varieties, but these are difficult to breed given that commercial varieties are seedless.  To enable future breeding, banana germplasm is conserved in multiple gene banks around the world.

<p><b>Physics</b> is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines.  A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. 
</p><p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps <i>the</i> oldest.  Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors.  Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined.  New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. 
</p><p>Advances in physics often enable new technologies.  For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

<p>A <b>banana</b> is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <i>Musa</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing them from <b>dessert bananas</b>.  The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors when ripe.  It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant.  Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) cultivated bananas come from two wild species – <i>Musa acuminata</i> and <i>Musa balbisiana</i>, or hybrids of them.  
</p><p><i>Musa</i> species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia; they were probably domesticated in New Guinea.  They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make banana paper and textiles, while some are grown as ornamental plants.  The world's largest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production.  Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in recipes varying from curries to banana chips, fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed. 
</p><p>Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between dessert "bananas" and cooking "plantains": this works well enough in the Americas and Europe, but it breaks down in Southeast Asia where many more kinds of bananas are grown and eaten.  The term "banana" is applied also to other members of the genus <i>Musa</i>, such as the scarlet banana (<i>Musa coccinea</i>), the pink banana (<i>Musa velutina</i>), and the Fe'i bananas.  Members of the genus <i>Ensete</i>, such as the snow banana (<i>Ensete glaucum</i>) and the economically important false banana (<i>Ensete ventricosum</i>) of Africa are sometimes included.  Both genera are in the banana family, Musaceae. 
</p><p>Banana plantations are subject to damage by parasitic nematodes and insect pests, and to fungal and bacterial diseases, one of the most serious being Panama disease which is caused by a <i>Fusarium</i> fungus.  This and black sigatoka threaten the production of Cavendish bananas, the main kind eaten in the Western world, which is a triploid <i>Musa acuminata</i>.  Plant breeders are seeking new varieties, but these are difficult to breed given that commercial varieties are seedless.  To enable future breeding, banana germplasm is conserved in multiple gene banks around the world.

</p>

<p>The <b>nematodes</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>NEM</span>-ə-tohdz</i> or <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>NEEM</span>-</i>; Greek: <span title="Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text"><span lang="grc">Νηματώδη</span></span>; Latin: <i lang="la">Nematoda</i>), <b>roundworms</b> or <b>eelworms</b> constitute the phylum <b>Nematoda</b></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments.  Most species are free-living, feeding on microorganisms, but many species are parasitic.  The parasitic worms (helminths) are the cause of soil-transmitted helminthiases. 
</p><p>They are taxonomically classified along with arthropods, tardigrades and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa.  Unlike the vaguely similar flatworms, nematodes have a tubular digestive system, with openings at both ends.  Like tardigrades, they have a reduced number of Hox genes, but their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox genotype, which shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum. 
</p><p>Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another.  Consequently, estimates of the number of nematode species are uncertain.  A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal <i>Zootaxa</i> puts this figure at over 25,000.  Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation.  A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode.  A subsequent publication challenged this claim, estimating the figure to be at least 40,000 species.  Although the highest estimates (up to 100 million species) have since been deprecated, estimates supported by rarefaction curves, together with the use of DNA barcoding and the increasing acknowledgment of widespread cryptic species among nematodes, have placed the figure closer to 1 million species. 
</p><p>Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem: from marine (salt) to fresh water, soils, from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations.  They are ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts, and are found in locations as diverse as mountains, deserts, and oceanic trenches.  They are found in every part of the Earth's lithosphere, even at great depths, 0. 9–3. 6 km (3,000–12,000 ft) below the surface of the Earth in gold mines in South Africa.  They represent 90% of all animals on the ocean floor. 
In total, 4. 4 × 10<sup>20</sup> nematodes inhabit the Earth's topsoil, or approximately 60 billion for each human, with the highest densities observed in tundra and boreal forests. 
Their numerical dominance, often exceeding a million individuals per square meter and accounting for about 80% of all individual animals on Earth, their diversity of lifecycles, and their presence at various trophic levels point to an important role in many ecosystems. 
They have been shown to play crucial roles in polar ecosystems. 
The roughly 2,271 genera are placed in 256 families. 
The many parasitic forms include pathogens in most plants and animals.  A third of the genera occur as parasites of vertebrates; about 35 nematode species occur in humans. 
</p>
<p>Nathan Cobb, a nematologist, described the ubiquity of nematodes on Earth thus:</p><blockquote><p>In short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by a film of nematodes.  The location of towns would be decipherable since, for every massing of human beings, there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes.  Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways.  The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites. <sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page:  472">(p 472)</span></sup>

<p>The <b>brain</b> is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  It consists of nervous tissue and is typically located in the head (cephalization), usually near organs for special senses such as vision, hearing and olfaction.  Being the most specialized organ, it is responsible for receiving information from the sensory nervous system, processing those information (thought, cognition, and intelligence) and the coordination of motor control (muscle activity and endocrine system). 
</p><p>While invertebrate brains arise from paired segmental ganglia (each of which is only responsible for the respective body segment) of the ventral nerve cord, vertebrate brains develop axially from the midline dorsal nerve cord as a vesicular enlargement at the rostral end of the neural tube, with centralized control over all body segments.  All vertebrate brains can be embryonically divided into three parts: the forebrain (prosencephalon, subdivided into telencephalon and diencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (rhombencephalon, subdivided into metencephalon and myelencephalon).  The spinal cord, which directly interacts with somatic functions below the head, can be considered a caudal extension of the myelencephalon enclosed inside the vertebral column.  Together, the brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system in all vertebrates. 
</p><p>In humans, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.  Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons, typically communicating with one another via root-like protrusions called dendrites and long fiber-like extensions called axons, which are usually myelinated and carry trains of rapid micro-electric signal pulses called action potentials to target specific recipient cells in other areas of the brain or distant parts of the body.  The prefrontal cortex, which controls executive functions, is particularly well developed in humans. 
</p><p>Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs.  They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones.  This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.  Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. 
</p><p>The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.  Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from a digital computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. 
</p><p>This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.  It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.  The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.  Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.  The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage.

<p>The <b>nematodes</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>NEM</span>-ə-tohdz</i> or <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>NEEM</span>-</i>; Greek: <span title="Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text"><span lang="grc">Νηματώδη</span></span>; Latin: <i lang="la">Nematoda</i>), <b>roundworms</b> or <b>eelworms</b> constitute the phylum <b>Nematoda</b></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments.  Most species are free-living, feeding on microorganisms, but many species are parasitic.  The parasitic worms (helminths) are the cause of soil-transmitted helminthiases. 
</p><p>They are taxonomically classified along with arthropods, tardigrades and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa.  Unlike the vaguely similar flatworms, nematodes have a tubular digestive system, with openings at both ends.  Like tardigrades, they have a reduced number of Hox genes, but their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox genotype, which shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum. 
</p><p>Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another.  Consequently, estimates of the number of nematode species are uncertain.  A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal <i>Zootaxa</i> puts this figure at over 25,000.  Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation.  A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode.  A subsequent publication challenged this claim, estimating the figure to be at least 40,000 species.  Although the highest estimates (up to 100 million species) have since been deprecated, estimates supported by rarefaction curves, together with the use of DNA barcoding and the increasing acknowledgment of widespread cryptic species among nematodes, have placed the figure closer to 1 million species. 
</p><p>Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem: from marine (salt) to fresh water, soils, from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations.  They are ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts, and are found in locations as diverse as mountains, deserts, and oceanic trenches.  They are found in every part of the Earth's lithosphere, even at great depths, 0. 9–3. 6 km (3,000–12,000 ft) below the surface of the Earth in gold mines in South Africa.  They represent 90% of all animals on the ocean floor. 
In total, 4. 4 × 10<sup>20</sup> nematodes inhabit the Earth's topsoil, or approximately 60 billion for each human, with the highest densities observed in tundra and boreal forests. 
Their numerical dominance, often exceeding a million individuals per square meter and accounting for about 80% of all individual animals on Earth, their diversity of lifecycles, and their presence at various trophic levels point to an important role in many ecosystems. 
They have been shown to play crucial roles in polar ecosystems. 
The roughly 2,271 genera are placed in 256 families. 
The many parasitic forms include pathogens in most plants and animals.  A third of the genera occur as parasites of vertebrates; about 35 nematode species occur in humans. 
</p>
<p>Nathan Cobb, a nematologist, described the ubiquity of nematodes on Earth thus:</p><blockquote><p>In short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by a film of nematodes.  The location of towns would be decipherable since, for every massing of human beings, there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes.  Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways.  The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites. <sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page:  472">(p 472)</span></sup>

<p>The <b>brain</b> is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  It consists of nervous tissue and is typically located in the head (cephalization), usually near organs for special senses such as vision, hearing and olfaction.  Being the most specialized organ, it is responsible for receiving information from the sensory nervous system, processing those information (thought, cognition, and intelligence) and the coordination of motor control (muscle activity and endocrine system). 
</p><p>While invertebrate brains arise from paired segmental ganglia (each of which is only responsible for the respective body segment) of the ventral nerve cord, vertebrate brains develop axially from the midline dorsal nerve cord as a vesicular enlargement at the rostral end of the neural tube, with centralized control over all body segments.  All vertebrate brains can be embryonically divided into three parts: the forebrain (prosencephalon, subdivided into telencephalon and diencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (rhombencephalon, subdivided into metencephalon and myelencephalon).  The spinal cord, which directly interacts with somatic functions below the head, can be considered a caudal extension of the myelencephalon enclosed inside the vertebral column.  Together, the brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system in all vertebrates. 
</p><p>In humans, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.  Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons, typically communicating with one another via root-like protrusions called dendrites and long fiber-like extensions called axons, which are usually myelinated and carry trains of rapid micro-electric signal pulses called action potentials to target specific recipient cells in other areas of the brain or distant parts of the body.  The prefrontal cortex, which controls executive functions, is particularly well developed in humans. 
</p><p>Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs.  They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones.  This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.  Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. 
</p><p>The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.  Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from a digital computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. 
</p><p>This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.  It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.  The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.  Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.  The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage.

                            <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                <h4>victory</h4>
                                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <p>The term <b>victory</b> (from Latin: <i lang="la">victoria</i>) originally applied to warfare, and denotes success achieved in personal combat, after military operations in general or, by extension, in any competition</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Success in a military campaign constitutes a strategic victory, while the success in a military engagement is a tactical victory. 
</p>

<p>In terms of human emotion, victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in human behaviour often exhibits movements and poses paralleling threat display preceding the combat, which are associated with the excess endorphin built up preceding and during combat. 
Victory dances and victory cries similarly parallel war dances and war cries performed before the outbreak of physical violence. 
Examples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">victoria</i></span> originated, include: the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus); and also the "abominable song" to Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579.  The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn. 
The Roman Republic and Empire celebrated victories with triumph ceremonies and with monuments such as victory columns (e. g.  Trajan's Column) and arches.  A trophy is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (<span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">spolia</i></span>), or body parts (as in the case of head hunters). 
</p><p>Mythology often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek Nike or the Roman Victoria.  The victorious agent is a hero, often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a monster (as Saint George slaying the dragon, Indra slaying Ahi, Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent etc. ).  Sol Invictus ("the Invincible Sun") of Roman mythology became an epithet of Christ in Christianity.  Paul of Tarsus presents the resurrection of Christ as a victory over Death and Sin (1 Corinthians 15:55). 
</p><p>The Latinate English-language word <i>victory</i> (from the 14th century) replaced the Old English equivalent term <span title="Old English (ca.  450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">sige</i></span>, cognate with Gothic <span title="Gothic-language text"><i lang="got-Latn">sigis</i></span> (<span title="Gothic-language text"><span lang="got">𐍃𐌹𐌲𐌹𐍃</span></span>), Old High German <span title="Old High German (ca.  750-1050)-language text"><i lang="goh">sigu</i></span>, modern German <span title="German-language text"><i lang="de">Sieg</i></span> (and a frequent element in Germanic names, such as in Sigibert, Sigurd), and to Celtic <span title="Celtic languages collective text"><i lang="cel">sego</i></span> and Sanskrit <span title="Sanskrit-language text"><i lang="sa-Latn">sáhas</i></span> (<span title="Sanskrit-language text"><span lang="sa">सहस्</span></span>).

<p><b>Light</b>, <b>visible light</b>, or <b>visible radiation</b> is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz.  The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively <i>optical radiation</i>. 
</p><p>In physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.  In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light.  The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization.  Its speed in vacuum, <span><span data-sort-value="7008299792458000000♠"></span>299<span>792</span><span>458</span> m/s</span>, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.  Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles.  The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics. 
</p><p>The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun.   Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps.  With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

In human physiology and psychology, sound is the <i>reception</i> of such waves and their <i>perception</i> by the brain.  Only acoustic waves that have frequencies lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, elicit an auditory percept in humans.  In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 meters (56 ft) to 1. 7 centimeters (0. 67 in).  Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans.  Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound.  Different animal species have varying hearing ranges.

                                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <p class="mw-empty-elt">

</p>

<p><b>Night</b> or <b>nighttime</b> is the period of darkness when the Sun is below the horizon</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  The opposite of nighttime is daytime.  Sunlight illuminates one side of the Earth, leaving the other in darkness.  Earth's rotation causes the appearance of sunrise and sunset.  Moonlight, airglow, starlight, and light pollution dimly illuminate night.  The duration of day, night, and twilight varies depending on the time of year and the latitude.  Night on other celestial bodies is affected by their rotation and orbital periods.  The planets Mercury and Venus have much longer nights than Earth.  On Venus, night lasts 120 Earth days.  The Moon's rotation is tidally locked, rotating so that one of the sides of the moon always faces Earth.  Nightfall across portions of the near side of the Moon results in lunar phases visible from Earth. 
</p><p>Organisms respond to the changes brought by nightfall, including darkness, increased humidity, and lower temperatures.  Their responses include direct reactions and adjustments to circadian rhythms, governed by an internal biological clock.  These circadian rhythms, regulated by exposure to light and darkness, affect an organism's behavior and physiology.  Animals more active at night are called nocturnal and have adaptations for low light, including different forms of night vision and the heightening of other senses.  Diurnal animals are active during the day and sleep at night; mammals, birds, and some others dream while asleep.  Fungi respond directly to nightfall and increase their biomass.  With some exceptions, fungi do not rely on a biological clock.  Plants store energy produced through photosynthesis as starch granules to consume at night.  Algae engage in a similar process, and cyanobacteria transition from photosynthesis to nitrogen fixation after sunset.  In arid environments like deserts, plants evolved to be more active at night, with many gathering carbon dioxide overnight for daytime photosynthesis.  Night-blooming cacti rely on nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths for reproduction.  Light pollution disrupts the patterns in ecosystems and is especially harmful to night-flying insects. 
</p><p>Historically, night has been a time of increased danger and insecurity.  Many daytime social controls dissipated after sunset.  Theft, fights, murders, taboo sexual activities, and accidental deaths all became more frequent due in part to reduced visibility.  Cultures have personified night through deities associated with some or all of these aspects of nighttime.  The folklore of many cultures contains "creatures of the night," including werewolves, witches, ghosts, and goblins, reflecting societal fears and anxieties.  The introduction of artificial lighting extended daytime activities.  Major European cities hung lanterns housing candles and oil lamps in the 1600s.  Nineteenth-century gas and electric lights created unprecedented illumination.  The range of socially acceptable leisure activities expanded, and various industries introduced a night shift.  Nightlife, encompassing bars, nightclubs, and cultural venues, has become a significant part of urban culture, contributing to social and political movements.

In the mid-19th century, the scope of algebra broadened beyond a theory of equations to cover diverse types of algebraic operations and structures.  Algebra is relevant to many branches of mathematics, such as geometry, topology, number theory, and calculus, and other fields of inquiry, like logic and the empirical sciences.

<p><b>Coffee</b> is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.  It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks. 
</p><p>Coffee production begins when the seeds of the <i>Coffea</i> plant's fruits (coffee cherries) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.  The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles.  Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out.  It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.  Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e. g. , espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).  Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.  There are also various coffee substitutes. 
</p><p>Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea.  The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.  The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen.  By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. 
</p><p>The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are <i>C.  arabica</i> and <i>C.  robusta</i>.  Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.  Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity.  The global coffee industry is massive and worth $495. 50 billion as of 2023.  In the same year, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total, followed by Vietnam and Colombia.  While coffee sales reach billions of dollars annually worldwide, coffee farmers disproportionately live in poverty.  Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.

<p><b>Humans</b> (<i><b>Homo sapiens</b></i>, meaning "thinking man") or <b>modern humans</b>  are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus <i>Homo</i></p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence.  Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations.  Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of cooperating, distinct, or even competing social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states.  As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society.  Humans are also highly curious, with the desire to understand and influence phenomena having motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine.  There are estimated to be more than eight billion humans alive. 
</p><p>Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, in common usage it generally refers to <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the only extant member.  All other members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term "modern human" is used to distinguish <i>Homo sapiens</i> from archaic humans.  Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> or a similar species.  Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans.  Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with <i>Homo sapiens</i>, or inability to adapt to climate change.  Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago.  For most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers.  The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change.  Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle. 
</p><p>Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span.  Though humans vary in many traits, humans are among the least genetically diverse species.  Any two humans are at least 99. 5% genetically similar.  Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage.  At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics.  Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.  As omnivorous creatures, they are capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of <i>Homo erectus</i>.  Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water.  Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day.  Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death.  Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. 
</p><p>Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.  Humans are highly intelligent and capable of episodic memory; they have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind.  The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence.  This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations through language. 
</p><p>Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment.  They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.  Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.  Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space.  Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.  Humans have briefly visited the Moon and made their presence felt on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.  Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.

<p>A <b>demon</b> is a malevolent supernatural entity</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Historically, belief in demons, or stories about demons, occurs in folklore, mythology, religion, and literature; these beliefs are reflected in media including comics, fiction, film, television, and video games.  Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from humanity's fear of the unknown, the strange and the horrific.  In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including early Judaism and ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity that may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism.  Large portions of Jewish demonology, a key influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism, and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era. 
</p><p>Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils: minions of the Devil.  In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc. ).  In religions featuring a principal Devil (e. g.  Satan) locked in an eternal struggle with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil.  As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions.

<p><b>Literature</b> is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially novels, plays, and poems</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  It includes both print and digital writing.  In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.  Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment.  It can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role. 
</p><p>The term is sometimes used synonymously with literary fiction, which encompasses fiction written with the goal of literary merit. Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoirs, letters, and essays.  Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles, or other written information on a particular subject. 
</p><p>Etymologically, the term derives from Latin <i><span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">literatura/litteratura</i></span></i>, "learning, writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from <i><span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">litera/littera</i></span></i>, "letter. " In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts.  Literature is often referred to synecdochically as "writing," especially creative writing, and poetically as "the craft of writing" (or simply "the craft").  Syd Field described his discipline, screenwriting, as "a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. "
</p><p>Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now include electronic literature.

<p>A <b>demon</b> is a malevolent supernatural entity</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Historically, belief in demons, or stories about demons, occurs in folklore, mythology, religion, and literature; these beliefs are reflected in media including comics, fiction, film, television, and video games.  Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from humanity's fear of the unknown, the strange and the horrific.  In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including early Judaism and ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity that may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism.  Large portions of Jewish demonology, a key influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism, and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era. 
</p><p>Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils: minions of the Devil.  In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc. ).  In religions featuring a principal Devil (e. g.  Satan) locked in an eternal struggle with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil.  As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions.

                                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <p><b>Faust</b> is the protagonist of a classic German legend based on the historical Johann Georg Faust (<abbr title="circa">c</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong> </abbr><span> 1480–1540</span>).  The erudite Faust is highly successful yet dissatisfied with his life, which leads him to make a pact with the Devil at a crossroads, exchanging his soul for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures.  The Faust legend has been the basis for many literary, artistic, cinematic, and musical works that have reinterpreted it through the ages.  "Faust" and the adjective "<i>Faustian</i>" imply sacrificing spiritual values for power, knowledge, or material gain. 
</p><p>The Faust of early books – as well as the ballads, dramas, movies, and puppet-plays which grew out of them – is irrevocably damned because he prefers human knowledge over divine knowledge: "He laid the Holy Scriptures behind the door and under the bench, refused to be called doctor of theology, but preferred to be styled doctor of medicine".  Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century, often reducing Faust and Mephistopheles to figures of vulgar fun.  The story was popularised in England by Christopher Marlowe, who gave it a classic treatment in his play <i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</i> (<abbr title="circa">c. </abbr><span> 1592</span>). 
In Goethe's reworking of the story over two hundred years later, Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for "more than earthly meat and drink" in his life.

                                <h4>legend</h4>
                                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <p>A <b>legend</b> is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude.  Legend, for its active and passive participants, may include miracles.  Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital. 
</p><p>Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not.  The Brothers Grimm defined <i>legend</i> as "folktale historically grounded".  A by-product of the "concern with human beings" is the long list of legendary creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends are "historically grounded. "
</p><p>A modern folklorist's professional definition of <i>legend</i> was proposed by Timothy R.  Tangherlini in 1990:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs. </p></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Stocks</b> (also <b>capital stock</b>, or sometimes interchangeably, <b>shares</b>) consist of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares.  This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the number of like shares each stockholder owns.  Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued, for example, without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders. 
</p><p>Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges.  Transactions of the former are closely overseen by governments and regulatory bodies to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy.  As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business.  Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price.  Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price.  This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option were exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).

<p><b>Art</b> is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting product that involves creative or imaginative talent, generally expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong> 
</p><p>There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes <i>art</i>, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures.  In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.  Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of "the arts".  Until the 17th century, <i>art</i> referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences.  In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. 
</p><p>The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.  The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.

<p><b>Coffee</b> is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans</p>
                                <p><strong>Additional Info:</strong>  Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.  It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks. 
</p><p>Coffee production begins when the seeds of the <i>Coffea</i> plant's fruits (coffee cherries) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.  The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles.  Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out.  It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.  Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e. g. , espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).  Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.  There are also various coffee substitutes. 
</p><p>Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea.  The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.  The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen.  By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. 
</p><p>The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are <i>C.  arabica</i> and <i>C.  robusta</i>.  Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.  Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity.  The global coffee industry is massive and worth $495. 50 billion as of 2023.  In the same year, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total, followed by Vietnam and Colombia.  While coffee sales reach billions of dollars annually worldwide, coffee farmers disproportionately live in poverty.  Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.
